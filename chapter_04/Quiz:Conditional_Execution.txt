1 - What do we do to a Python statement that is immediately after an if statement to indicate that the statement is to be executed only when the if statement is true?

Answer: Indent the line below the if statement



2 -Which of these operators is not a comparison / logical operator?

Answer: " = "



3 - What is true about the following code segment:

if  x == 5 :
    print('Is 5')
    print('Is Still 5')
    print('Third 5')


Answer: Depending on the value of x, either all three of the print statements will execute or none of the statements will execute



4 - When you have multiple lines in an if block, how do you indicate the end of the if block?

Answer: You de-indent the next line past the if block to the same level of indent as the original if statement



5 - You look at the following text:

if x == 6 :
    print('Is 6')
    print('Is Still 6')
    print('Third 6')

It looks perfect but Python is giving you an 'Indentation Error' on the second print statement. What is the most likely reason?
    //This is very tricky so lest go step by step.


Python thinks 'Still' is a mis-spelled word in the string
    //Python don't check for the grammar of you spelling inside the "string"

In order to make humans feel inadequate, Python randomly emits 'Indentation Errors' on perfectly good code - after about an hour the error will just go away without any changes to your program
    // Well.... this is ridiculus

Python has reached its limit on the largest Python program that can be run
    // As long you have the memory and the CPU power, you program can be as large as you whant.

Answer: You have mixed tabs and spaces in the file
    // This is confusing, but in some text editors, the tabs are not the same as teh 4 spaces indet
    and that calls for a indet error even if in the screen seems the same. 





7 - What is the Python reserved word that we use in two-way if tests to indicate the block of code that is to be executed if the logical test is false?


Answer: else
    //The curlybraces are not words and the other to are not in the lis of reserved words. 



8 - What will the following code print out?

    x = 0
    if x < 2 :
        print('Small')
    elif x < 10 :
        print('Medium')
    else :
        print('LARGE')
    print('All done')


Answwer: Small All done
    //This is tricky, you may think that alls the statements are valid, and thats is true, "x" can run all the options.
    But you can only run the firts statement that acomplish the parameters, then the final "print" because is 
    de-indet and dont take part in the if-else statement.



9 - For the following code,

    if x < 2 :
        print('Below 2')
    elif x >= 2 :
        print('Two or more')
    else :
        print('Something else')

What value of 'x' will cause 'Something else' to print out?


Answer: This code will never print 'Something else' regardless of the value for 'x'
    //  The code evalues a number less that 2 or "from" 2 to up, theres no room for other number.



10 - In the following code (numbers added) - which will be the last line to execute successfully?

    (1)   astr = 'Hello Bob'
    (2)   istr = int(astr)
    (3)   print('First', istr)
    (4)   astr = '123'
    (5)   istr = int(astr)
    (6)   print('Second', istr)

Answwer: 1
    // When try to parse "astr" to "int",that conteing the string 'Hello Bob', you get an error
    you cannot parse string to numbers



11 - For the following code:

astr = 'Hello Bob'
istr = 0
try:
    istr = int(astr)
except:
    istr = -1

Answer: -1
    //You get an error whe try to parse a "string" to "int" and then the "except" is execute.
