If you were building an XML Schema and wanted to limit the values allowed in an xs:string field to only those in a particular list, what XML tag would you use in your XML Schema definition?

Answer: xs:enumeration



For this XML Schema:

  		<xs:sequence>
    		<xs:element name="lastname" type="xs:string"/>
    		<xs:element name="age" type="xs:integer"/>
    		<xs:element name="dateborn" type="xs:date"/>
  		</xs:sequence>
	</xs:complexType>

And this XML,

	<person>

   		<dateborn>2001-04-17</dateborn>
