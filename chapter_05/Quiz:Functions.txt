1 -  Which Python keyword indicates the start of a function definition?

Answer: def
// function definition (def)



2 - In Python, how do you indicate the end of the block of code that makes up the function? 

Answer: You de-indent a line of code to the same indent level as the def keyword
// The relation of dependence in statements is in base the indentation, other wise, you code will not work in Python.



3 - In Python what is the input() feature best described as?

Answer: A built-in function
// All the functions that are predefined in a programming language are called built-in functions.



4 - What does the following code print out?

    def thing():
        print('Hello')
    
    print('There')

Answer: There
// In the code the function y is defined but is never called/invoked, so only the print is executed.


5 - In the following Python code, which of the following is an "argument" to a function?

    x = 'banana'
    y = max(x)
    print(y)

Answer: x
// The argument is the data that you pass to the function to be processed.


6 - What will the following Python code print out?

    def func(x) :
        print(x)
    
    func(10)
    func(20)

Answer: 1020
// Because is printing numbers and not string, the print does not generate a new line.



7 - Which line of the following Python program will never execute?

    def stuff():
        print('Hello')
        return
        print('World')

Answer: print ('World')
// The line is never executed because the return statement ends the function.
You can only have a return inside of every function.


8 - What will the following Python program print out?

    def greet(lang):
        if lang == 'es':
            return 'Hola'

            return 'Bonjour'
        else:
            return 'Hello'

Answer: Bonjour Michael
// The argument passed to the "greet" function is 'fr', lang will be equal to 'fr' and then it will return "Bonjour"



9 - What is the most important benefit of writing your own functions?

Answer: Avoiding writing the same non-trivial code more than once in your program
// Avoids repetition of your code and makes it more compact.
